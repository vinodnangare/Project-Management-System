## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Redux DevTools
When testing locally:
1. Install Redux DevTools extension for Chrome/Firefox
2. Open the app
3. Open DevTools (F12)
4. Click "Redux" tab
5. Create a task and see the action in real-time
6. You can time-travel through your actions!

### Tip 2: Check Database Directly
```bash
mysql -u root -p
USE task_management;
SELECT * FROM tasks;
SELECT * FROM task_activities;
exit
```

### Tip 3: Read Architecture First
Before diving into code, understanding the architecture helps immensely:
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) explains the "why"
- Code explains the "how"

### Tip 4: Use Troubleshooting Section
Most issues are in [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md) Troubleshooting section. Check there first!

### Tip 5: Explain One Layer at a Time
When explaining to seniors, break it down:
1. Database layer (MySQL)
2. Service layer (business logic)
3. Controller layer (HTTP)
4. API client layer
5. Redux layer (state management)
6. Component layer (UI)
